\title{Get the state of Slurm jobs}
\usage{
get_job_state(sjobid = NULL, days = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sjobid}{Slurm \code{JobID}}

\item{days}{Number of days to look back}
}
\value{
Data frame with \code{jobID}, \code{State}, and \code{Reason}
}
\description{
Gets the Slurm State and Reason codes for a specific job or all jobs launched
in the past n days.
}
\details{
Either specify the \code{sjobid} with the Slurm \code{JobID} to get the state for a
single job, or \code{days} to get the state for all jobs run in the past \code{days}
days. If you don't specify either, you'll get the Slurm default: jobs you
launched today.

There is overhead for the Slurm call, so if processing several jobs, best to
use an adequate value for days and pull info on your jobs from the result.

Only the primary \code{JobID}s are returned; \verb{_batch}, \verb{_extern}, and other
sidecar jobs are dropped.

\code{get_job_state} uses the Slurm \code{sacct} command, and results differ slightly
from those returned by \code{squeue}. Interacting with Slurm requires setting up
\code{ssh} to connect to a login node.
